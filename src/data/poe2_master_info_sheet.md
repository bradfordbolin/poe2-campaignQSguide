## General Rules (from leveling strategy)

### Stat priority
- Movement Speed > Resistances > Life > Base damage > Damage scaling > Armor/Evasion

### Crafting & currency
- Runes are the strongest campaign crafting tool (weapon damage runes; armor resistance runes).
- Salvage all socketed and quality gear you aren’t using.
- Early: prioritize gold to buy key bases/flasks/jewelry; later mix in disenchanting for shards.
- Save major currency (Exalted/Chaos/Divine) for trade/endgame.
- Use Transmutes freely; Augments sparingly; Regals on strong 2-mod magic items; Alchs sparingly on an up-to-date weapon or long-term utility item.

### Survival
- Keep moving; run circles around enemies; 'hug the boss' for easier dodging.
- Use life flask preemptively.
- Resist cap matters greatly; target specific resistances for known upcoming bosses.

### Common fixes

**Attributes:**
- Respec flexible attribute nodes (small gold cost)
- Get attributes on gear
- Grab bonus attribute nodes if needed


**Mana:**
- Upgrade mana flasks constantly
- Use charge regen suffix for bosses
- Trim high-mana supports
- Mana/regen on gear
- Mana on kill for clearing; leech is supplemental early

### QoL / techniques
- CTRL+Click shortcut to NPC interactions (e.g., identify all).
- Checkpoints: teleport to discovered checkpoints; respawn-at-checkpoint can reset zones.
- Movement skills via temporary mace/shield + uncut gem (Leap Slam / Shield Charge); weapon swap passives can temporarily allocate STR nodes; dodge-roll to animation-cancel landing.

## Verification flags (must confirm later)

- **Act 4 - Blind Beast reward includes +2 weapon-set points** — User-provided walkthrough summary claims points + Blank Greater Rune; other external notes indicate 0.4 moved the tome to Dark Mists/Omniphobia. Verify against patch notes/in-game.
- **Act 4 - Halls of the Dead: Navali grants +2 weapon-set points** — User-provided summary attributes points to Navali; external notes suggest reward tied to Trial completion; verify.
- **Interlude 2 - Sacred Wells guarantee Exalted Orb + Orb of Alchemy** — Often reported inconsistently; treat as unconfirmed until validated.
- **Interlude 2 - Orbala's Pillar exact boon options** — User-provided list may be incomplete/variable; verify.

### Data formats to support per-build inserts (v1)

**Goal:** move “level breakpoints / checklist items / new gear” into the relevant campaign guide sections, while keeping the build overlay’s static panels (How to Play / Key Tips) unchanged.

**Campaign progression sections (build-agnostic)**
- `campaign_progression_sections.sections[]`
  - `id` (e.g. `sec_01`)
  - `order` (1..N)
  - `chapter` (Act/Interlude label)
  - `section_title` (display label)
  - `zones[]` (search/filter helpers)
  - `common_level_range.{min,max}`
  - `common_level_range_display` (e.g. `14-15`)

**Build overlay definition (per build)**
- `build_overlays[]`
  - `id`, `name`, `class`, `ascendancy`, `source_url`
  - `static_panels.how_to_play` (string/markdown)
  - `static_panels.key_tips` (string/markdown)
  - `milestone_groups[]`: `{ id, label, level_range:{min,max}, items[] }`
  - `section_inserts[]`: `{ campaign_section_id, milestone_group_ids[], checklist_item_ids[], placement_hint, notes }`
  - `rules.auto_map_milestone_groups.method = "level_range_overlap"` (optional helper rule)

**Recommended rendering rule (simple default)**
- When rendering a campaign section, show any milestone group whose `level_range` overlaps that section’s `common_level_range`.
- Allow manual overrides via `section_inserts[]` when a build needs a specific placement.
## Checklist generation rules (v2 rebuild)

### Goal
- **Speedrun mode:** show only **permanent power** (permanent buffs/stat choices, skill-point books, ascendancy unlocks, key/unlock benches) **plus required progression bosses**.
- **Full mode:** Speedrun items **plus** explicitly marked **optional bosses/content**.

### Data-driven overrides (in `poe2_master_db.json`)
`checklist_overrides` provides deterministic rules to prevent “Defeat: quest/secret/hub/monument” noise and to drive filtering:

- `key_classifications` (map): key string → `required | optional | never_checklist`
- `classification_default`: fallback for unknown keys (recommended: `optional`)
- `optional_key_suffix_regex`: pattern to mark optional keys when no explicit classification exists
- `permanent_power_tags`: reward tags that always classify as `required` (permanent buffs, skill points, ascendancy, unlocks)

### Implementation note
- Item IDs should remain stable across refactors (hash of `section_id` + normalized display text).
- `src/data/*` copies must be refreshed from the root master files when master data is updated.
