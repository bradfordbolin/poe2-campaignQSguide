CODEx VS CODE PROMPT TEMPLATE (copy/paste)

Context / Guardrails
- Repo is already open in VS Code.
- Branch policy: MAIN ONLY. Do all work on `main` unless I explicitly say otherwise.
- Keep changes minimal and incremental. Prefer small diffs over refactors.
- Preserve existing localStorage / persistence keys unless I explicitly request a reset/migration.
- If you change data files: also keep `src/data/*` copies in sync with the repo-root master files.

Before you start
1) In the VS Code terminal, run and verify:
   - git status
   - git branch --show-current
   - git pull
2) If branch is not `main`, stop and tell me what branch it is.
3) If there are uncommitted changes, stop and tell me which files.

Task
- Objective:
  [WRITE THE SINGLE CLEAR OUTCOME HERE]

- Requirements (must-haves):
  1) [...]
  2) [...]
  3) [...]

- Non-goals (do NOT do these):
  - [...]
  - [...]

Files / Areas to search
- Likely entry points:
  - src/App.tsx
  - src/lib/*
  - src/components/*
  - src/styles/* or src/index.css
  - poe2_master_db.json and src/data/poe2_master_db.json (if data model changes)
- Search terms to locate relevant code:
  - ["normalize", "checklist", "sections", "mode", "theme", "localStorage"]

Implementation instructions
1) Locate the current implementation and briefly identify:
   - the file(s) you will edit
   - the function/component names involved
2) Implement the change with these constraints:
   - Avoid breaking existing types/contracts unless necessary
   - Add defensive defaults (never crash on missing data)
   - Keep UI uncluttered and readable

If data changes are required
- Edit the canonical repo-root file(s) first:
  - /poe2_master_db.json
  - /poe2_master_info_sheet.md
- Then sync into:
  - src/data/poe2_master_db.json
  - src/data/poe2_master_info_sheet.md

Testing (must run locally)
1) npm install
2) npm run dev
   - confirm no blank page and no red console errors
3) npm run build
4) npm run preview
   - confirm assets load correctly and app works

Git actions (do at the end)
1) git status (confirm expected changed files only)
2) git add [ONLY the intended files]
3) git commit -m "[SHORT IMPERATIVE MESSAGE]"
4) git push

Deliverable
- Provide a short summary:
  - what changed (1–5 bullets)
  - which files were modified
  - what to manually verify in the UI (3–5 checks)

Notes
- If you discover conflicts with existing behavior or ambiguity, choose the least risky option and leave a TODO comment explaining the alternative.
